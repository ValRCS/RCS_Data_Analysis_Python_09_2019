# Pytesseract

https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/

Python-tesseract is a python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR


## Installation

!pip install pytesseract (or simply pip install pytesseract from command line)

Also you need to innstall Google Tesseract OCR (additional info how to [install the engine on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)). You must be able to invoke the tesseract command as tesseract. If this isn’t the case, for example because tesseract isn’t in your PATH, you will have to change the “tesseract_cmd” variable pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd
